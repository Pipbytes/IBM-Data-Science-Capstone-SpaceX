# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX


## Introduction
This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone, designed to demonstrate the end-to-end data science process, from data collection to building predictive models and visualizations. The project applies the skills and concepts learned throughout the course to solve a real-world data science problem.

## Objective
The goal of this capstone project is to:
* Analyze a given dataset to extract meaningful insights.
* Build machine learning models to predict outcomes or classify data.
* Present findings and insights through compelling visualizations.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection: [Briefly describe how data was collected or obtained].
2. Data Wrangling and Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distributions, relationships, and trends.
4. Feature Engineering: Create and optimize features for the machine learning models.
5. Modeling: Build and evaluate predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
6. Visualization and Presentation: Use visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
